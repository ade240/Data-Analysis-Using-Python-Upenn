# 
# #### In this assignment, you will continue working on the movie data from IMDB.
# - The data includes movies and ratings from the IMDB website
# - Data File(s): imdb.xlsx
# 
# #### Data file contains 3 sheets:
# - “imdb”: contains records of movies and ratings scraped from IMDB website
# - “countries”: contains the country (of origin) names
# - “directors”: contains the director names
# 
# We have loaded and joined the data as "df" for you. Follow the instructions and finish the rest part.
